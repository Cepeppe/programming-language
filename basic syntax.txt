Program entry point:
The entry point of the program is the file passed to the interpreter (the "executed file").
A program is a sequence of top-level declarations and statements.
Top-level statements are executed from top to bottom when the program starts.
The interpreter:

1. loads that file,
2. processes its import statements,
3. and executes its top-level statements from top to bottom.

Comments: 
    // this is a Comment
    var number a = 5 // this is also ok as a comment

Statements:
    A statement ends at end-of-line (EOL) or at ;
    
    for example:
        var number a = 5
        var string b = "abc"
    'var number a = 5' is a statement and 'var string b = "abc"' is a statement

    Also:
        var number a = 5; var string b = "abc";
    Also in this case both 'var number a = 5' and 'var string b = "abc"' are statements

Basic types:
    -number
        number literals are decimal numbers with 
        optional fractional part, e.g. 0, 42, 3.14.
        The - sign is treated as the unary minus operator.
    
    -string
        allowed delimiter is "
        Backslash escape sequences are supported:
            \", \\, \n, \t
        A string literal cannot span multiple lines.
    
    -bool    
        Boolean literals are 'true' and 'false' (lowercase)

Constants:
    // Constants cannot be re-assigned
    const number pi = 3.14 //this is a number constant

Variables:

    // Variables have a block scope, 
    // A variable declared in an outer 
    //   block is visible in all its inner blocks.
    // A variable declared in an inner block is not 
    //   visible outside that block.
    // It is a compile-time error to declare a variable 
    //    with name x in a block if x is already declared 
    //    in any enclosing block.
    // A variable can not be redefined in an internal scope
    
    //Using a variable before its declaration is a compile-time error.
    
    example:
        var number a = 1
        {
            var number b = 2
            // here: a is visible, b is visible
        }
        echo(a)      // OK
        echo(b)      // ERROR: b not visible

    // NB: each uninitialized variable assumes its default value for each data-type
    // example: var number k; // k assumes value 0
                var string s; // s assumes value "" (empty string)
                var bool b;   // b assumes value false
    -Declarations:
        var number a
        var string b = "abcde" //this is a string variable

    Assignment
        a = 2 //numeric variable a now has value 2

Expressions:
    - Arithmetic
        + - * / % ^
    - Compare
        == != < <= > >=
    - Logic
        and or not 
    
    Operators precedence:
        ^ (right-associative), -(unary)
        #
        not(unary)
        * / %
        + -
        < <= > >=
        == !=
        and
        or

    All binary operators, except ^, are left-associative.
    The ^ operator is right-associative.
    Unary operators (-(unary), not) are prefix.

        Operators allowed types: 
            and, not, or    -> bool
            ^ * / + - %     -> number
            < <= > >=       -> number, string
            == !=           -> number, string, bool 
            #               -> strings

        String comparisons (<, <=, >, >=) use lexicographical, case-sensitive order.
        comparisons can be made only between operands having the same data type

    Examples and types of expressions:
        1 + 2 / 2    // this is an arithmetic expression
        a + 2        // this is an arithmetic expression
        true and false // this is a boolean expression
        1 < 2          // this is a boolean expression
        "string here"  // this is an expression
        "abdde" + 1    // this is not a valid expression

Flow control:
    // NB: in flow operations expressions
    //     must always be boolean expressions

    if ( expression ) {
        ...
    } else if ( expression ){
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }

    loop( expression ){
        ...
    }
    // loop executes the block while expression is evaluated as true

Functions:

    Functions can only be declared at top level (not inside blocks or other functions)

    func add(number a, number b){
        return a+b;
    }

    func noreturn(number c, number d){
        echo (c)
        echo (d)
    }

    A function that does not execute a return statement does not return a value.
    Using the result of a function that does not return a value in an expression is a compile-time error.

    -Function call:
    var number sum = add(1, 5)
    noreturn(3, 4) 

Imports:
    import "file.spl"

    Interpreter reads and interprets the file 
    as if it was pasted at that position

    Each file is imported at most once.
    
Built in:
    exit(code: number)
    
    echo(expr)
        //NB: internally it always makes string(expr) before printing

    strlen(s: string) -> number returns the length of the string s.

    # this is the string concatenation operator
        example: a = "abc" # "def"
                 echo (a) //prints abcdef
    NB: "abcde" # 5 is not allowed. You must cast the number to string before concatenation.
        Example: "abcde" # string(5).

    Casting:
        Any type mismatch or casting/parsing error is a runtime error and aborts program execution.
        
        string()
            examples:
                string(1); string(true) //are all valid 
        number() 
            examples:
                number("12.3") //is valid
                const pi = "3.14"; number(pi) //is valid
                number("sdajdash") //number parsing error
        bool()  
            bool(x: string) expects a string equal to "true" or "false" (case-insensitive).
            If the string is not "true"/"false", it causes a boolean parsing error.
            Calling bool() with a non-string argument is a type error.
            examples:
                bool("True"); bool("False"); bool("true");
                bool("abcde") //boolean parsing error
                bool(0);      //type error
                bool(1);      //type error
